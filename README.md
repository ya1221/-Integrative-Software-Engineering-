# ðŸŒ¿ Smart Indoor Air Quality Management System

A modular, layered server-side system designed to simulate ambient intelligence for enclosed spaces. Developed in a team of five using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, the system supports real-time monitoring and manual/automated control of environmental conditions (COâ‚‚, humidity, temperature) through smart virtual objects such as sensors, purifiers, and windows.

Key features include:

    RESTful API with full CRUD support

    Role-based access control (ADMIN, OPERATOR, END_USER)

    Data persistence via Dockerized PostgreSQL and JPA

    Object linking and command invocation

    Input validation and clean layered architecture

    Task management via Trello, version control via Git/Bitbucket
